# Pokemon_capture_chance

This is a fun project where I try to calculate the chance you have to capture a given Pokemon. Maths are based on equations found on fan made wiki. 

This is only working for Gen III and Gen IV game.\
You have to give the french version of pokemon's name 

There is two versions for this program. One is a CLI client and the other one is a GUI client. \
Both are in their respective branch in this repo.
